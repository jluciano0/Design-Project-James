      <div class="gallery1"> <br><br><br> Hello, <br><br> I'm James, the creator of this webpage which I designed and coded for the term 1 project of my Design Coding class. <br> <br>
        Ever since I can remember I have always loved movies and TV shows/series. My interest started off when my dad used to take me to see some blockbusters in the theaters here and there (the first being Captain America: The Winter Soldier), but as I grew older I started becoming a regular filmbuff and developed my own taste in film and TV. <br><br>
        Recently I have been really getting into the historical aspects in film such as the Mafia, World Wars, real life crime cases, you name it. This is what inspired me to have the idea to merge the two topics together for the base of my webpage. 
        <br><br> 
        This topic is someting I'd say I'm really passionate about on top of being able to code it which is something else I have always been interested in so I hope you, presumably another filmbuff or someone looking into film enjoy my webpage and share it to others as it is something that's special to me.
